## Technologies
The Restaurant-Page application was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- npm
- Git
- GitHub


## File Structure
The project files are organized as follows:

- `dist/`: The "dist" directory contains contains the optimized and bundled version of the Restaurant-Page application. It includes minified and optimized JavaScript, CSS, and other assets ready for deployment. This folder is automatically generated by webpack during the build process, and it's where you can find the final version of the Restaurant-Page that is ready to be deployed to a production environment.

- `src/`: The "src" directory contains the source code material for the Galactic Cantina application. It serves as the central hub for all the code files that are essential for the functionality and behavior of the application.
node
- `node_modules/`: An automatically created directory when dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager) or a similar package manager are installed.

- `gitignore`: This file tells git which files it should not track or maintain a version history for. It is used to prevent the "node_modules/" from being added to the project repository.

- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

- `package.json`: This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies.

- `webpack.config.js`: This file is used to manage and configure the webpack bundler. It contains the configuration settings for the webpack bundler, which includes the entry point, output path, and loaders.
